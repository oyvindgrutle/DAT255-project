# DAT255-project

## Introduction

This repository contians multiple notebooks exploring the dataset from the Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge, which is available to download on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/overview

What we have created is a model for classifying the different aduio files from the dataset into the 41 different categories. After exporting this model we experimentet with transfer learning and using our own pretrained model on a new dataset. For this we used the UrbanSound Dataset. More info on this dataset and download can be found on this site: https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound.html

Our methods are mostly built on the fastai library and the methods used in the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/).

[Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) is also used a lot to process and manage the audiofiles and make image representations of the audio files in order to classify them as images.
